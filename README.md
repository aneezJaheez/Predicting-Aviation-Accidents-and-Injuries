## Overview
A machine learning project that aims to predict injury severity, count, and aircraft damage of aviation accidents by analyzing historical accidents with data points such as altitude, location, aircraft type, and passenger count.

## Libraries Used
* [Python 3.6.12](https://docs.python.org/3.6/)
* [scikit-learn 0.24.1](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [imbalanced-learn 0.8.0](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/index.html)
* [graphviz 0.16](https://graphviz.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html)

and other essential libraries which include Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## The Dataset

### Dataset Source
The data used in this project has been adapted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses), a popular repository for community published datasets. The dataset contains records of air vehicles involved in aviation accidents. It also contains attributes holding information about the vehicle and other external factors that may have caused the accident.
